# **NEUROTRANSMITTERS**
## Morphology of a neuron:
* A neuron consists of a cell body, which contains the genetic material, dendrites and an axon.
* It also has oligodendrocites, the non-neuronal cells that provide myelin sheath on the axon.
* Myelin- a fatty insulating substance that regulates axon potential velocity.
* Neurons are linked to each other through synapses. 
* Signals in a neuron travel unidirectionaly from the dendrite to the axon.
## Neuron excitation:
* Membrane potential- refers to the difference in charge between the inside and outside of a neuron.
* When the neuron is at rest the concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions is more on the outside and the concntration of K+ is more on the inside.
* The resting membrane potential of an average neuron is around -70mV.
* Action potential is a momentary inversion of the membrane potential.
* The process of action potential:
1.**Resting potential**: the voltage difference across the membrane when the neuron is at rest is around -70mV.
2.**Depolarization**: The influx of positive ions like Na+ makes the inside of the neuron more positive, and the potential becomes less negative. This process is known as depolarization.
3.**Threshold**: If the depolarization reaches a certain threshold voltage, usually around -55mV, an action potential is triggered.
4.**Action potential**: Once the threshold is reached, a rapid and temporary change in the membrane potential occurs. The voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing more Na+ ions to enter the neuron. This causes a rapid depolarization of the cell membrane, making the inside of the neuron more positive than the outside. The potential reaches a peak of around +30mV.
4.**Repolarization**: After the peak potential is reached, the voltage-gated sodium channels close, and the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels open. K+ ions move out of the cell, repolarizing the cell membrane and restoring the resting potential.
5.**Hyperpolarization**: In some neurons, the K+ channels stay open longer than necessary, causing the potential to become more negative than the resting potential. This is known as hyperpolarization and makes the neuron less likely to fire again.
## Synapse:
* At the synapse the electrical signals are converted to chemical signals.
*  The presynaptic portion contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters and the postsynaptic portion contains neurotransmitter receptors.
*  Calcium concentration increases when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, which fuses the vesicles wiith the membrane and neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft.
### Postsynaptic receptors-
1. Ionotropic receptors-
 * are a type of neurotransmitter receptor that are directly linked to ion channels. When a neurotransmitter binds to an ionotropic receptor, it opens or closes a specific channel.
 * When positive ions flow into the neuron, the membrane potential  becomes more positive, or depolarized. This triggers an action potential in the neuron, which can then lead to the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse with the next neuron.
 * When negative ions flow into or out of the neuron,  the membrane potential becomes more negative, or hyperpolarized. This makes it more difficult for an action potential to be generated in the neuron.
2. Metabotropic receptors-
* are a type of neurotransmitter receptor that are indirectly linked to ion channels and are slow acting receptors.
* When a neurotransmitter binds to a metabotropic receptor, the G protein protein dissociates from the receptor. The G protein then initiates a series of intracellular signaling events that close/open ion channels, the release of second messengers, or the activation of other signaling molecules.
## Excitatory neurotransmission:
* Excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by glutamate.
* Some common glutamate recptors are AMPA, NMDA, kainate receptors.
* During excitatory neurotransmission, glutamate is released from the presynaptic neuron and binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. These receptors are permeable to positively charged ions such as Na+ and Ca+, which flow into the postsynaptic neuron and depolarize it(EPSP). This depolarization generates an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.
* Glutamate plays an important role in sensory perception, motor control, learning, memory etc.
## Inhibitory neurotransmission:
* Inhibitory neurotransmission is mainly mediated by GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid).
* Ionotropic GABA (GABA_A) receptors are permeable to negatively charged ions such as chloride, which flow into the postsynaptic neuron and cause it to become hyperpolarized. This hyperpolarization(IPSP) can make it more difficult for the neuron to generate an action potentia, by driving it away from the threshold.
* When GABA levels are too low, neurons get overexited, leading to restlessness and irritability.
## Neuromodulation:
* The function of a neromodulator is to alter the synaptic strength, by controlling the amount of neirotransmitter synthesised.
*  Dopamine is a catecholamine and is considered a neurmodulator because it diffuses via volume transmission.
*  Dopamine is essential in regulation of movement, motivation, reward and reinforcement.
## Synaptic strength:
* Synaptic strength refers to the degree of effectiveness with which a synapse transmits signals from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron.
* It is measured by the change in postsynaptic neuron potential in response to a presynaptic stimulation.
* Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process by which the strength of a synapse is increased in response to repeated stimulation. LTP is the cellular mechanism by which learning occurs.

# **NEURONS TO CONSCIOUSNESS:**
## Why study the brain:
1.To better underatsnd the impact of psychiatic and neurological diseases and disorders.
2.To understand consciousness and its evolutionary origin.
3.To improve the abilities of brain by artificial means.
4.To build intelligent machines.
## Diversity of neurons:
* There exist thousands of different kinds of brain cells.
* These cells differ in shape, dendritic and axonal structure, projection targets, developemental trajectory etc.
* It is important to understand different kinds of brain cells to understand the overall functioning of the brain, and also because some diseases are cell specific.
## The cortex:
* It is the outermost layer of the brain.
* It is a highly convoluted sheet of neurons that is 1200-1300 sq. cm in area in humans.
## Electrical and morphological classification of neurons:
### Electrical classification:

* Excitatory neurons: These neurons increase the activity of other neurons.
Inhibitory neurons: These neurons decrease the activity of other neurons.
### Morphological classification:

* Multipolar neurons: These neurons have multiple dendrites and a single axon..
* Bipolar neurons: These neurons have a single dendrite and a single axon.
* Unipolar neurons: These neurons have a single process that extends from the cell body, which then splits into a dendrite and an axon. 
 
 ## The human brain:
 * Weight = 1300 gm
 * Cortical surface area = 2500 sq cm
 * Number of neurons = 86 billion
 * Number of cortical neurons = 16 billion
 ## The neuronal correlate of consciousness:
The neuronal correlate of consciousness (NCC) refers to the set of neuronal processes or activity that underlie conscious experience. It is the search for the specific patterns of neural activity that give rise to subjective experience, such as the perception of color, sound, touch, or emotion.
## Computational challenges faced by neuroscientists:
* Mammalian brains have a large number of neurons, around 10^8-10^11 neurons.
* There are thousands of different types of brain cells.
* Each neuron is connected to around 10^3-10^4 other neurons.
The large diversity and recurrence makes it difficult to understand the brain through a computational approach.
