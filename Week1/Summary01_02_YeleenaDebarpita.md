# Origin and interpretation of EEG&MEG signals
## History of EEG(ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY)
* During 19th,20th century,many researchers tried to report electrochemical activity of the brain.
* Richard Caton measured electrical activity in rabbit and monkeys around 19th century.
* Hans berge developed EEG in 1929 which measures electrical potential difference.Difference between two different cerebral locations can be measured as-
                          PO7=(PO7-g)-(Cz-g)
## History of MEG(Magnetoencephalography)
* Hans Cristian Orsted discovered-electric current produces a circular magnetic field.Hence,the electric current in the neural network generates magnetic fields as well.
## Origin of signal-EEG
* Dendrites of pyramidal neurons-parallel to each other,so excitatory post synaptic potentials(PSP) sum across space and time.
* PSP occur when there is exchange of +vely & -vely charged ions b/w extracelluar and intracellular space.
* This changes membrane voltage of post synaptic cell.
* Simultaneous PSP by a group of active neurons are large enough to be captured by EEG electrodes on scalp,e.g.
_alpha- oscillations(freq.=8 to 13 Hz.) seen when eyes closed and relaxed_
## Reading in EEG and MEG
* In EEG,electrodes mapped on scalp in a specific way.
* They are either 10 or 20% of the total front-back or right-left distance of the skull.
* Each electrode has a letter(identifies lobe/areas of brain like Z,P,O,F) AND nos. whic identify the brain hemisphere(even-right,odd-left).
* EEG has active(has embedded amplifier,so less prone to surrounding noise) and passive electrode(no amplifier).
* Brain's neuromagnetic signals extremely small so SQUID(superconducting quantum interference device used by MEG) used.
### Artifacts
* Signals not generated by brain and thus their data must be cleaned for reading EEG,MEG.
* 2 Types-->q
         * Physiological-Caused by eye blink,squeezing teeth
         * Non-phisiological-Caused by electrical phenomenon                 like cell phones 
* Around 50k-100k neurons generate measurable magnetic field.
## Forward and inverse modelling
* Let's take an example-
  *We generate the shadow of a deer using two hands.
  *Here hands are physiological source(P) while deer is output(O)
  *If P known,one can eadily model what the output will like-FORWARD MODELLING.
  *If O known,it's hard to configure P- INVERSE MODELLING.
  
##  Experimental design and output
  1)Stimulus presentation(SP) (2 types)
  a)SP for 100ms then 100ms interstimulus interval
  b)Stimulus flickering @ particular interval
  2)EEG/MEG recording
  3)Collection of raw EEG/MEG data-in form of signal which is sum of sine waves
  4)ERP(Event Related Potentials)
 
 
 ## fMRI-Functional Manetic Resonance Imaging
 * Relatively new neuroimaging technique 
 * Probes mesoscopic brain dynamics
 * One of the type of MRI
 * Based on blood oxygenation
 ### History
 * 1990 Ogawa observed BOLD effect-blood vessels became more visible as blood oxygenation decreased.
 * 1992-first functional images using BOLD signal published
 * BOLD signal still used in most fMRI approaches
 ### HOW do we measure fMRI?
 *  MRI machines use an extremely strong magnet 
 *   **MRI vs. fMRI** 
  -- MRI uses magnetic fields & radio waves to produce high quality 2D or 3D images of the brain structure & function with programs know as “sequences”  
-- By selecting specific MR sequence parameters different MRI signals  obtained from different tissue types (sMRI) or from metabolic changes (fMRI)
 *    **fMRI v/s sMRI**
 1)*fMRI*
▪ A series of images (time series)
 ▪Each image takes < 3 s  
 ▪Low resolution (3 mm)
 ▪Sequence optimized  oxygenated vs. deoxygenated blood      (BOLD)
 ▪Assembled into a stastical image
 2)*sMRI*
 ▪One image
 ▪Takes approx. 4-6 min
 ▪High resolution (1 mm)
 ▪Sequence optimized  Differential contrasts GM & WM
  *   Typical setup for an fMRI experiment 
 *   Typical fMRI experiment

## WHAT does fMRI measure?
* measures activity  of neurons indirectly
* changes in BOLD signal after a stimulusis called hemodynamic response	 
## WHICH types of experiment can be done  with fMRI?
* **Block Designs compare different conditions-->**
       ● For example, eyes open vs eyes closed 
       ●Statistical comparison of these two-condition activation
* **Event Related Designs compare different stimuli -->**
       ●For example, different  Navon figures allow identifying areas related to attention to shape and to layout
* **Resting State Designs records background brain activity unrelated to any task-->**
      ●Measures the functional connectivity during the resting (task-free) state
       ●Temporal correlations between the signal in distant brain regions 



# Senses
* Brain's task to integrate info from outer environment and act upon it
## Visual System
* Light detected by photoreceptors
*  In retina ganglion cells feed this info to the visual thalamus (Lateral geniculate nucleus)
* This info then forward to primary visual cortex(V1) 
* There are pathways dorsal and ventral which lead to higher visually cortical areas
### Neural representation of sensory information
* Receptive fields of neurons (the region within the visual field in which stimulation can affect the neuron's response)
* visual world mapped in a topographic manner -*Retinotopic map*
* *Spiked trigger Averaging (STA)* average stimuli before spike we find receptive field
* we see similar to camera,  centre of vision is *fovea*
* *ON-centre OFF -surround* & *OFF-centre ON -surround* in retina and LGN
* oriented edges are found everywhere in the visual environment
* *Tuning curve* fire rate as a func of stimulus feature that u test
*  broad tuning curve represents unselective neuron
*  motion direction represented in polar plot
*  spacial frequency tuning  curves 
*  neurons hv response selectivity
*  receptive field of neuron meaused with light spots so the on response shown in red or dark spot in red , when we overlay these on and off we get *edges detection*
*  *Gabor filters= sinusodial wave * gaussian kernel* (localized sine wave)
*  RELATIONSHIP B/W DIFFERENT CORTICAL SENSORY REPRESENTATIONS
      1)ON and OFF receptor field mapped onto cortical surface - origin of orientation map
      2)series of recording sites simultaneously recorded across horizontal dimension of cortex - origin of functional organizations
* as we move away from visual cortex the representation more complicated


## Neurons
* Neurons highly specialized cells- unique morphology 
* small processes- dendrites
*  long process- axon
* *Oligodendrocytes* -non neuronal systems of CNS -provide myelin sheath
* *Myelin*- fatty white substance wraps aroud axon provides coating
* *Myelin sheath* regulates axon potential conduction velocity
* signals generally unidirectional

## Neuron excitability
* *Membrane potential* diifference in electric charge due to grouping of ions
* +ve Na ions -ve Cl ions(mostly outside)  
* K+ions , organic anions(inside mostly)
* Resting membrane potential -70 mV
* *Action potential* momentary inversion of membrane potential
* *Depolarization* movement of resting membrane potential to more +ve value
* *At this time large number of Na channels open* -rising phase of action potential
* Action potential at peak Na channels close
* K channels open , loss of K -*repolarization* by making inside membrane more -ve
* Hyperpolarization resting potential moves to more -ve value
* Refractory period neuron quiet (not activated)
* Action potential reaches axon terminal at synapse voltage gated calcium channels open 
* calcium conc increases- fusion of vesicles with membrane
* allows neurotransmitter to be released in synaptic cleft and communicate with postsynaptic neuron
* Presynaptic cell Electrical signal -> chemical signal
* chemical-> electrical when neurotransmitter binds to receptor

## Post synaptic receptors
* receptors large proteins embedded in plasma membrane
* ionotropic receptor -ligand gated ion channels
   1) -ve chaege ion flow into cell resting membrane potential moves away from action potential hyperpolarizes -IPSP
  2)  depolariztion of post synaptic neuron -EPSP
* Metabotropic receptors( G -protein coupled receptors) -slow acting that tune and modulate func over long time.They do not hv ion channel
  1) When neurotransmitter binds G protein unbinds and either interacts directly with ion channel or binds to effector protein(enzymes) and start intacellular signalling pathways
 * Many can activate both to produce fast and slow postsynaptic potentials
 * Glutamate or excitatory neurotransmission-epsp
     - Glutamate  -nonessential amino acid doesnt cross blood brain barrier
     - involved in cognition, learning, memory
* GABA or inhibitory neurotransmitter-ipsp
   -  1/3rd synapses use it
   - binds to GABA -A(ionotropic) GABA -B(metabotropic)
   - significant mood modulator GABA levels too low may lead to restlessness, anxiety ,irritability
* Neuromodulator (Dopamine -biogenic amines) released diffusely via volume transmission(i.e. into neuronal tissue not synapse)
* Func to alter strength of signal transmission b/w neurons
* can also alter neuronal signal transmission by controlling amount of neurotransmitters synthesized and released
* Synaptic strength change in postsynaptic neuron potential in response to presynaptic stimulation
